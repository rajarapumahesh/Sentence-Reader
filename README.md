# Sentence-Reader
 Sentence by Sentence Reader is a web app facilitating focused reading of PDFs by presenting sentences individually. Users upload PDFs, and the app extracts text, displaying one sentence at a time in a distraction-free interface. Navigation buttons enable easy progression. The dark theme enhances readability and reduces visual distractions.
